# Joseph is learning digital logic subject which will be for his next semester. He usually tries to solve unit
# assignment problems before the lecture. Today he got one tricky question. The problem statement is “A
# positive integer has been given as an input. Convert decimal value to binary representation. Toggle all bits of
# it after the most significant bit including the most significant bit. Print the positive integer value after toggling
# all bits”.
# Constraints :
# 1<=N<=100
# Example 1:
# Input :
# 10 
# Output :
# 5
n=int(input())
a=bin(n)
a=a[2:]
a=a.replace('0','x')
a=a.replace('1','0')
a=a.replace('x','1')
b=int(a,2)
print(b)
